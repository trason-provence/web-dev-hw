# Assignment 2

A Version Control System allows a user to easily keep record of changes made to a specific file at a specific time. The changes have to be committed to a master, where the finished result stands. Along with this, a VCS also gives the user an option to give a brief description of what the changes consist of, which makes one's work easy to go back to and easy to locate. VCS's also allow the user to go back to previous work if they want to. The one we are using in this class, GitHub, keeps everyone connected and on the same page. By this, I mean that all of the users are able to see the changes and when they were changed, which can be of use to someone looking for it.

Here are [my responses](./responses.txt).

To start this assignment, I went to the course website and went through each focus area. I made sure to watch every video from start to end so I could have a good understanding of the material I would be working with, which I found to be very useful. Whenever an optional quiz/assessment came up, I would take it until I got all of the points possible. Then, I followed the examples step-by-step to ensure my browsers were looking the same. After I had went through all of the material, I went to the assignment details and took it slow to remember what I had learned. However, I did find some trouble in navigating through some of the examples simply because I had changed the name of a folder after cloning and it wasn't recognizing. After switching the name back and starting the clone process again, I had no troubles.
