      Hello, all who have visited are are reading this! My name is Trason Provence
      and I'm a student at the Universit of Montana located in Missoula, Mt,
      where I'm majoring in Media Arts and minoring in Journalism. Currently,
      I'm enrolled in classes like Animation, Web Development, Photojournalism,
      Ethics (along with the metaphysics of ethics) and Photoshop. I grew up in
      Salmon, ID and have always had a passion for the oudoors, but have also
      never been one to say no to a lazy day. To be honest, I don't really know
      why I chose cinnamon pancakes as a recipe to display on a website, but I
      love pancakes and I wanted to make it a little more appealing by adding
      cinnamon. Anywhere I have ever had pancakes, whether it be at home by mom
      or across the world in Europe, they have always been great, but with their
      own spin. I'm open to anyone's recipe(s)!

      This is an assignment that tests us our use of html coding and the ability
      to put those acquired skills into action by creating a website from the
      ground up, following a certain protocol of course. So, I made a How-To, if
      you will, on making cinnamon pancakes. Why? Because pancakes are comfort
      and I thoroughly enjoy them.

      Below is a video of an animation I made this year, starring unknown giants,
      a falling leaf, a penguin and a blimp. It was made using DragonFrame,
      which I used to capture 107 hand-drawn pictures on an index card. Then, it
      was transferred to Premiere, where I adjusted the frame rate and added
      audio clips taken from an online source. It's my first digital animation,
      and first flip-book creation for that matter. I hope you enjoy!
