<h2>A Time To Believe</h2>

<h3>B.J. Morbitzer</h3>

<pre>
  To believe is to know that
  every day is a new beginning.
  Is to trust that miracles happen,
  and dreams really do come true.

  To believe is to see angels
  dancing among the clouds,
  To know the wonder of a stardust sky
  and the wisdom of the man in the moon.

  To believe is to know the value of a nurturing heart,
  The innocence of a child's eyes
  and the beauty of an aging hand,
  for it is through their teachings we learn to love.

  To believe is to find the strength
  and courage that lies within us
  When it's time to pick up
  the pieces and begin again.

  To believe is to know
  we are not alone,
  That life is a gift
  and this is our time to cherish it.

  To believe is to know
  that wonderful surprises are just
  waiting to happen,
  And all our hopes and dreams are within reach.

  If only we believe.
