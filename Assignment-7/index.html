<div class="line-horizontal"></div>

<div class="Paragraph-1">
<h5>Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO</h5>
</div>

<div class="Paragraph-2">
  <h4>ANTONIO</h4>

  <p>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:</p>
  <p>It wearies me; you say it wearies you;</p>
  <p>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</p>
  <p>What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,</p>
  <p>I am to learn;</p>
  <p>And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,</p>
  <p>That I have much ado to know myself.</p>
</p>
</div>

<div class="Paragraph-3">
<h4>SALARINO</h4>

  <p>Your mind is tossing on the ocean;</p>
  <p>There, where your argosies with portly sail,</p>
  <p>Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,</p>
  <p>Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,</p>
  <p>Do overpeer the petty traffickers,</p>
  <p>That curtsy to them, do them reverence,</p>
  <p>As they fly by them with their woven wings.</p>
</p>
</div>

<div class="Paragraph-4">
<h4>SALANIO</h4>

  <p>Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,</p>
  <p>The better part of my affections would</p>
  <p>Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still</p>
  <p>Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,</p>
  <p>Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;</p>
  <p>And every object that might make me fear</p>
  <p>Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt</p>
  <p>Would make me sad.</p>
</p>
</div>

<div class="Paragraph-5">
<h4>SALARINO</h4>

  <p>My wind cooling my broth</p>
  <p>Would blow me to an ague, when I thought</p>
  <p>What harm a wind too great at sea might do.</p>
  <p>I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,</p>
  <p>But I should think of shallows and of flats,</p>
  <p>And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,</p>
  <p>Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs</p>
  <p>To kiss her burial. Should I go to church</p>
  <p>And see the holy edifice of stone,</p>
  <p>And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,</p>
  <p>Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,</p>
  <p>Would scatter all her spices on the stream,</p>
  <p>Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,</p>
  <p>And, in a word, but even now worth this,</p>
  <p>And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought</p>
  <p>To think on this, and shall I lack the thought</p>
  <p>That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?</p>
  <p>But tell not me; I know, Antonio</p>
  <p>Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</p>
</p>
</div>

<div class="Paragraph-6">
<h4>ANTONIO</h4>

  <p>Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,</p>
  <p>My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,</p>
  <p>Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate</p>
  <p>Upon the fortune of this present year:</p>
  <p>Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</p>
</p>
</div>

<div class="Paragraph-7">
<h4>SALARINO</h4>

  <p>Why, then you are in love.
