# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo

# Trason Provence


I decided to take this class because I want to further my knowledge with web processing and how they get developed. I'm a Media Arts major, and, although this class may be required, I'm very excited to partake in it. I took a creative coding course last semester and I thought it was so interesting how Atom can manipulate code.

But what is the internet, really? I found that:

  - the internet is a connection made up of local internet providers who send and receive information from each other.
  - there is no central system, they are all part of the big picture.
  - there are literal cables that connect continents together in order to expand the system.
  - the "deep web" consists of 80 percent of the entire internet.
  - we get a lot of internet terms from the ocean.
